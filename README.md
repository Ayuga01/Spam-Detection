# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

Overview

This project implements a Spam Detection System using Machine Learning to classify messages as spam or ham (not spam). The model is trained on a dataset of text messages and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze the text data.

Features

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer

Machine Learning Models: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, or Deep Learning

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Web Interface (Optional): Flask/Streamlit-based UI for real-time spam detection

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK/SpaCy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment (Optional): Flask/Streamlit

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages, typically sourced from public datasets like SMS Spam Collection. It contains:

Spam Messages: Unwanted promotional or fraudulent messages

Ham Messages: Legitimate messages

Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection.git
cd spam-detection

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Train the Model

python train.py

2. Test a Sample Message

python predict.py "Congratulations! You've won a free gift. Claim now!"

3. Run the Web Application (if available)

streamlit run app.py

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness

Precision: Percentage of correctly identified spam messages

Recall: Percentage of actual spam messages identified correctly

F1-Score: Balance between Precision and Recall

Future Enhancements

Implement Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers)

Improve dataset by adding more real-world spam samples

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI with a user-friendly UI
